Title: 
As a user, I want to be able to see reports of injuries and reasons why expeditions failed for the purpose of planning for future expeditions.

Assumptions/Preconditions:
Assuming that injuries are tracked. Early termination will be accessed through Expeditions ID in the database.

Description:
The stakeholders want it to be very easy for anyone who visits the site to be able to easily view terminated expeditions and the reasons why. This is to encourage potential trekkers to make the appropriate preperations for their expedition. Here are some specifics.
	
	1. An easy to read display of the peak and year the expedition was on, the reason for termination.
	2. Display a limited selection of terminated expeditions.
	3. Each refresh of the page should refresh the selection displayed.
	
Tasks:
	1. Implement the display function in the Home Controller.
	2. Unintrusivly display the resulting function's result to the home.
	
Effort Points: 2
