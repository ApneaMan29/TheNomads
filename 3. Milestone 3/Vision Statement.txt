For music enthusiasts who are in search of music, our website, (project name?) is designed to serve. Our website allows users to link with their Spotify account and will bring their playlists into our website where we are able to offer other members playlists that contain many of the same tracks. Our website will also allow users to search for music and see some of the playlists these tracks are attached to. This will allow members to find music that is similar in nature to their own likes that they might not have known about. Our website is unique in that it will allow any user to find playlists and be able to see other users playlists as well.
