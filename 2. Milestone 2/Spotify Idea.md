Spotify Idea
=====================================
In this idea, we are trying to configure a way for the user to access playlists and find new music for already existing spotify users. 
Currently the search function within the base spotify application, with membership and free, doesnâ€™t have a way in which user created playlist to be found through the application, we are trying to expand that utility. 
This meaning that the web application that we would create would expand the parameters in which playlists could be found. 

The base search function within spotify only applies to exact word searches(track names and playlist names) and limits you to friends with you in spotify. 
By broadening this using user pages within the application, there would be ways to add on to this functionality. 
Whether it be genre playlists sorted by popularity, or finding certain curators for playlists that would show all their playlist. 

Once the application has authorization, obtained by signing into spotify within the web browser, it would show your music playlists(other things within the spotify API, maybe even for apple music or even youtube playlists with music if functionality of those API give enough information.) 
Using an algorithm, it would search for playlists within spotify or users in the app and show you. 
We want to see an environment where people could share their spotify playlists with just a link that maybe popular social media pages could then use. 

We believe that this project would be around a 6 using things that we have already learned in our years of pursuit of a CS degree and also by incorporating some features that would take independent learning to implement.
