What did we learn from Sprint 6:
    - Learned to do more and more testing. Thinking 
        outside the box
    - Learned more about and how to create BDD tests
    - Learned to interact more with Spotify's API
    - Learned how to do more and more Unit tests
    - Learned more about OAuth requests


What isn't going well:
    - How everything is starting to speed up: class, 
        testing, sprints, graduation
    - Communication amongst team members.
    - More communication and comments on the code
    - Testing can be very difficult and hard, 
	especially BDD tests


What can the team do better next Sprint:
    - Time management, especially as everything 
        is coming to a close (school, graudation)
    - Testing and making sure features are tested from 
        all angles to avoid exceptions and errors
    - Adding more and more comments to the code when
        implementing so others can walk through it easier


What needs to be brought up to Scot:
    - N/A
