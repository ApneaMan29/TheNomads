What did we learn from Sprint 5:
    - Learned to do more and more testing. Thinking 
        outside the box
    - Learned styling, including HTML and CSS
    - How to create BDD tests
    - Creating more refined user stories
    - Learned to interact more with Spotify's API
    - Learned more about GET and POST requests


What isn't going well:
    - How everything is starting to speed up: class, 
        testing, sprints, graduation
    - Trying to catch up with more sprint expectations
    - Communication amongst team members.
    - Explaining thought process before implementing 
        designs and algorithms
    - Sometimes working on top of each others Features
        which can lead to confusion and errors
    - More communication and comments on the code


What can the team do better next Sprint:
    - Time management, especially as everything 
        is coming to a close (school, graudation)
    - Testing and making sure features are tested from 
        all angles to avoid exceptions and errors
    - Helping each other with code and being quick 
        to respond and help one another
    - More refined user stories that better explain 
        what we are trying to implement
    - Adding more and more comments to the code when
        implementing so others can walk through it easier


What needs to be brought up to Scot:
    - N/A
