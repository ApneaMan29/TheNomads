<h2 id="our-vision-statement">Our Vision Statement</h2>
<p>For music enthusiasts who are in search of music, our website is designed to serve. Our website brings allows users to search for music by keywords and find playlists that will suit their likes. Our website will also show recommended music based on several factors to our users. Our website allows users to link with their Spotify account and will bring their playlists into our website where we are able to offer other members playlists that contain many of the same tracks. By linking their Spotify account with ours, we will be able to offer a more personalized experience in the form of recommended music based on playlists and listening history. Our website will also allow users to search for music and see some of theplaylists these tracks are attached to. This will allow members to find music that is similar in nature to their own likes that they might not have known about. Our website is unique in that it will allow any user to find playlists and be able to see other users playlists as well.</p>

<h2 id="rules-and-conventions">Rules and Conventions</h2>
<p>To promote group synergy and to encourage efficient coordination we have agree on a documented, and standard, naming conventions. We've settled on using PascalCase for Classes/Constructors/Methods and camelCase for local variables, field names, and arguments.
Documentation can be found here (https://github.com/ktaranov/naming-convention/blob/master/C%23%20Coding%20Standards%20and%20Naming%20Conventions.md).

For git management we've settled on another documented practice that we can all refer to. This is to ensure that git networking is easy to read and allows for easier git maintained. Documentation for these methods are found here (https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices/).</p>
