Conduct a Safety Check if you can meet in person; what were the results? If you're holding it remotely, choose a different activity method from Fun Retrospectives.
What did you learn from the Sprint?
Taught us the group procedures
How we should communicate to be on the same page
 
What isn't going well?
Not enough initiative or direction
Get the .gitignore working before every sprint
All leaders but one person initiates/shifts/paves the direction of the group
 
What can the team do better during the next Sprint? You must make a specific Action Plan.
Use pivotal tracker more for clarity and direction
Communicate if we change anything to the group
 
Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)
No questions
