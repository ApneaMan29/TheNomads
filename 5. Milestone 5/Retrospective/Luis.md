Conduct a Safety Check if you can meet in person; what were the results? If you're holding it remotely, choose a different activity method from Fun Retrospectives.
We used the “The Ball Asks” from FunRetrospectives
 
What did you learn from the Sprint?
Taught me the procedure of how the sprint works
What is expected of me
Taught me how the group works and the dynamics of the group is kind of hard.
 
What isn't going well?
More communication
Voice our opinions
Not worried about offending each other
Not worried about being uncomfortable
Everyone take the initiative to lead
Taking problems on early
 
What can the team do better during the next Sprint? You must make a specific Action Plan.
More communication and voicing our thoughts
Tackling problems early
Quick to help our group partners
 
Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)
Not for me
