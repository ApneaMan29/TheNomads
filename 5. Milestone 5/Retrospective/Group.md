For the Group

Conduct a Safety Check if you can meet in person; what were the results? If you're holding it remotely, choose a different activity method from Fun Retrospectives.
We used the “The Ball Asks” from FunRetrospectives

What did you learn from the Sprint?

Taught me the procedure of how the sprint works.
What is expected of me as a individual.
Taught me how the group works and the dynamics of the group is kind of hard.
Taught us the group procedures.
How we should communicate to be on the same page.
How hard it is to work with a team when the group isn’t able to meet in person.
It’s difficult to work together when everyone is spread out and haven’t met together as a group.
Better understanding of how git works and repositories work.

What isn't going well?

Voice our opinions
Not worried about offending each other
Not worried about being uncomfortable
Everyone takes some initiative to lead
Taking problems on early
Get the .gitignore working before every sprint
All leaders but one person initiates/shifts/paves the direction of the group
Lack/difficult communication
No established programming standard. Harder to see what others did.
Large gap of not meeting with other team members at the end of the week
Not knowing what others did until Monday
It’s difficult to have meetings during the evening.
Large gap of communications between meetings.

What can the team do better during the next Sprint? You must make a specific Action Plan.

More communication and voicing our thoughts
Tackling problems early
Quick to help our group partners
Use pivotal tracker more for clarity and direction
Communicate if we change anything to the group
Each of us fall under a similar naming conventions
On Thursday, maybe pick one of the following days to meet(Fri-Sun)
Working together on Visual Studio.
Working liveshare.
For troubleshooting when others are having trouble.
Communicating
Benefit on getting into a routine where we come into the meeting knowing already what we need to talk about/work on during the meeting.

Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)
No Question
