Conduct a Safety Check if you can meet in person; what were the results? If you're holding it remotely, choose a different activity method from Fun Retrospectives.
What did you learn from the Sprint?
It’s difficult to work together when everyone is spread out and haven’t met together as a group.
Better understanding of how git works and repositories work.

What isn't going well?
It’s difficult to have meetings during the evening.
Large gap of communications between meetings.

What can the team do better during the next Sprint? You must make a specific Action Plan.
Communicating
Benefit on getting into a routine where we come into the meeting knowing already what we need to talk about/work on during the meeting.

Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)
No questions
